# getModelsList
AWS Lambda function code to get all the models list of vehicle from https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles API.

Generally, you might be having requirement to get list of all the models of different makers but unfortunately, there is no readymade API available on NHTSA portal. Hence, I created this API to replicate the use case.

This repo is AWS lambda compatible so you can directly take clone and use in your project.

Cheers!
